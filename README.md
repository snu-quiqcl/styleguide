# styleguide
A style guide for development projects in QuIQCL.

Sharing conventions among the codes in our group would be helpful to produce consistent and legible codes.
Please follow this guide and actively use issues and discussions for asking, suggesting, etc.

Basically we are going to follow [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).
In this style guide, we want to specify the things that are not decided in Google Style Guides,
e.g., whether to use `'` or `"` for string literals.

If there is anything ambiguous, see Google Style Guides.
If it is not enough, please create an issue or a discussion.
This style guide will become more complete and useful as we ask to and discuss with each other.
